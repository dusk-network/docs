title: Upgrade your node
description: Learn how to update your Dusk node to the latest version of the Nocturne testnet.

A network may be occasionally upgraded with new features and performance optimizations.

To make the upgrade process as flawless as possible, the [node installer](https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer) script may be updated from time to time. This script can be ran in a non-destructive way, meaning it changes only what is needed. It will gracefully shut down Rusk for you.

## How to Upgrade

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Tabs syncKey="network">
    <TabItem label="Mainnet">

    To upgrade to the latest mainnet version, run:

    ```bash
    # mainnet upgrade
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Testnet">

    To upgrade to the latest Nocturne testnet version, run:

    ```bash
    # testnet upgrade
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash -s testnet
    ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once it's done and gives no errors, start Rusk again:
```sh
service rusk start
```

If everything is up and running again, query the node a couple of times to see if the block height is progressing:
```sh
ruskquery block-height
```

Or keep an eye on the logs to see if it's making and accepting new blocks:
```sh
tail -F /var/log/rusk.log
```

If you see new blocks being accepted, you're up and running again.

You can see the status of the Rusk service here:
```sh
service rusk status
```

If it is not running after starting it, and reports an error, you can check your logs to see if something is wrong, like a wrong password or no peers being found:
```sh
tail -n 30 /var/log/rusk.log
```

## Nocturne Reset

:::note[Info]
This only applies for testnet.
:::

Sometimes the Testnet gets reset. For that you need to reset the state of Nocturne.

1. To reset the state of Nocturne, download the latest version of our installer:
```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSfL https://github.com/dusk-network/node-installer/releases/latest/download/node-installer.sh | sudo bash -s testnet
```

2. Reset all the data on your node:
```sh
ruskreset
```
Type in **Y** to accept the deletion of all the state.

3. Start Rusk:
```sh
service rusk start
```

4. Check if you're already staking by running:
```sh
rusk-wallet stake-info
```
If you already have DUSK staked, wait until the chain starts producing blocks. You can check [our explorer](https://testnet.apps.dusk.network/explorer/) to see if the chain is progressing or when it will produce the genesis block.

1. If you do not have testnet DUSK, request nDUSK from the [faucet](/operator/guides/nocturne-faucet).

2. Stake your nDUSK:
```sh
rusk-wallet stake --amt 1000 # Or however much you want to stake
```
