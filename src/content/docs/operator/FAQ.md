description: Frequently asked questions about running a node on Dusk.
---

## General

#### Which operating system is recommended?

**Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** is officially supported, tested and therefore recommended.

#### Which node should I run to participate in consensus?

The full node that is used to take part in the consensus is the [**provisioner node**](/operator/provisioner).

#### Can I build Rusk from source?
Yes, instructions to build Rusk from source can be found [here](/operator/from-source)

#### Which ports does Dusk use?

- **9000/udp**: Required for Kadcast message dissemination.
- **8080/tcp**: Optional HTTP(S) API for querying the node.

You can use ports other than 9001 and 9000, as long as inbound traffic is allowed for those ports and outbound UDP traffic is allowed for most ports.

#### Can public and private ports be the same?
Yes, public port and private port can be the same. More information about the meaning of those can be found [here](https://docs.rs/kadcast/0.7.0/kadcast/config/struct.Config.html).


####  How to know if my node is running on the correct chain ID?

You can launch `ruskquery info` to check the chain ID of your node. If you have a chain ID of **1**, it indicates that your node is running on mainnet.

#### How many blocks are there in one epoch?

One epoch consists of **2160** blocks.

## Staking

#### What is the minimum amount of DUSK I must stake?

**1000** (1 thousand) Dusk.

#### Stake Top-Ups & Compounding
You can increase your stake at any time without needing to unstake first. However, a **fixed penalty of 10%** is applied to the additional amount staked.

The fixed 10% penalty is applied whenever you increase your stake, including when reinvesting rewards to compound your holdings. This portion of the restaked amount is added to your inactive stake, where it will become eligible for rewards after completing the maturity period. 

For example:

- When you add **1000 DUSK** to your stake, 10% of that amount (equivalent to **100 DUSK**) will be moved to your inactive stake, while the remaining **900 DUSK** will transition to your active stake after the standard maturity period.
- Similarly, if you restake **500 DUSK** in rewards, **50 DUSK** will go to inactive stake, and **450 DUSK** will eventually contribute to your active stake.

This mechanism promotes fairness within the staking system while ensuring that all contributions are eventually rewarded.

## Security

#### What about maintenance & security?

Maintaining a secure and stable node is important for the proper functioning of your consensus participation. We recommend using a firewall, restricting access to unused APIs, performing regular updates, and using a static IP for uninterrupted service.

#### Are my keys secure on a server/vps?

The wallet stores your keys in encrypted form. In addition, the keys that the node uses in-memory to participate in consensus can be separated from other keys.

Your stake is defined by a consensus key and an owner. The owner is by default the same key, but can also be a contract or separate key. Your Public Balance is held by a key too, the same goes for the private, shielded Balance.

1. If your owner key is set to a different key, no one is able to unstake, stake or withdraw using your consensus key.
2. If the key you use to send funds around is set to a different key than the consensus key, no one will be able to send funds from your wallet using your consensus key.
   - This is naturally the case for shielded accounts as they use different keys by default.
   - For public accounts you need to create a separated account holding your public account balance.

In summary, consensus keys can be strictly limited to signing consensus messages such as block proposal, validation, and voting. All other critical operations, such as unstaking or sending funds, can be separated to other keys.

#### What if I lose access to my server or keys?

As long as you have your mnemonic phrase stored safely, you can recover everything else.

#### What should I do if I lose my SSH-key file?
Unstake using the web wallet, destroy your droplet, and follow the setup procedure to recreate your node.

## How To's

#### How can I stake 3000 DUSK?

You can use:

```bash
rusk-wallet moonlight-stake --amt 3000
```

#### How can I run a Dusk node on Docker?
We don't support a production-ready Docker image for Rusk. To run Rusk through Docker as ephemeral (non-persistent storage), you can use the following command: 

```bash
docker run -p 9000:9000/udp -p 8080:8080/tcp dusknetwork/node
```

This command starts a temporary node instance without persistent storage. Data will be lost if the container stops.

#### How do I configure Kadcast to use a port other than 9000/udp?

Bootstrapper nodes are used during initial synchronization to help your node join the network. They operate on their own predefined Kadcast port (9000 by default).

If you configure your node to use a different port (e.g., 42069), itâ€™s crucial to ensure that other nodes, including bootstrappers, are aware of and can adapt to this port. Otherwise, they will not route messages to your node.

**With the Node Installer:**
If you are using the Node Installer, it is recommended to specify Kadcast configuration updates in `/opt/dusk/services/rusk.conf.user`. This file takes precedence over `rusk.conf.default` and ensures your changes are retained during updates. 

You can add or modify the following section:

```bash
KADCAST_PUBLIC_ADDRESS=<MY_WAN_IPv4:<NEW_PORT>
KADCAST_LISTEN_ADDRESS=<MY_LOCAL_IPv4:<NEW_PORT>
```

It is important to note that:

- On a VPS, the `KADCAST_PUBLIC_ADDRESS` and `KADCAST_LISTEN_ADDRESS` are often the same, as the public IPv4 is directly exposed to the internet.
- If you are running your node from home, behind NAT, a private network, or VPN, these may differ. Ensure you configure your local IP and port accordingly, and verify that the port is forwarded correctly on your router.
- `/opt/dusk/services/rusk.conf.user` is the highest priority file. Changes to `rusk.toml` will be overridden by the default `rusk.conf.default` configuration.

**Without the Node Installer:**


If you are **not** using the Node Installer, you will need to explicitly define the ports and IPs in the `[kadcast]` section of the `rusk.toml` file. Here's an example:

```bash
[kadcast]
bootstrapping_nodes = [
    { address = "165.22.193.63", port = <new-port> },
    { address = "167.172.175.19", port = <new-port> }
]

[http]
listener_addr = "0.0.0.0:8080" # Default HTTP listener address
```

You can override the HTTP listener port by:

- Using the `--http-listener-addr` flag (e.g. `--http-listener-addr 0.0.0.0:8081`).
- Modifying the `listener_addr` in the rusk.toml file as shown above.
- Setting it as an environment variable (e.g. `HTTP_LISTENER_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8081`).


Configuration precedence is not applicable here, as settings are directly defined in `rusk.toml`.


#### How to setup SSH on Digital Ocean?

To set up SSH on DO, you can follow the steps below.

1) Generate an SSH key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

2) Add the public key to Digital Ocean during droplet creation:
```bash
ssh -o "IdentitiesOnly=yes" -i myssh root@<your-droplet-ip>
```

3) Secure your droplet by removing the default console:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge droplet-agent
```

#### How can I transfer an SSH-key to another device?

Copy the `.ssh` folder and key files to the new device from `~/.ssh` (Linux).

#### How can I get data from testnet or mainnet nodes?

First, set up the base URLs:

Testnet: `testnet.nodes.dusk.network`
Mainnet: `nodes.dusk.network`

For example:

```javascript
const WS_URL = 'https://nodes.dusk.network/on';
const EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_URL = 'https://nodes.dusk.network/on/blocks/accepted';
```
Then, initialize a Rusk session by sending a POST request to the session endpoint (`WS_URL`). The server will `return a Rusk-Session-Id`:

```json
{
    "sessionId": "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl"
}
```
Use this session ID as an HTTP header (Rusk-Session-Id: <ID>) when subscribing to events at `EVENT_SUBSCRIPTION_URL`.

Finally, keep a websocket connection open using the session ID. Events will be sent to your websocket in real time.


#### How can I relay my internal port 8080 when using RUES?
You can relay your internal port using `socat`:

```bash
socat tcp-listen:8081,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:8080
```
This makes local port 8080 available on port 8081 and allow you to access it via external-ip:8081. To turn this into a service, you can create a `/etc/systemd/system/rusk-relay.service` file with the following content:

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Rusk relay
After=rusk.service
Requires=rusk.service

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=socat tcp-listen:8081,reuseaddr,fork tcp:localhost:8080
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
