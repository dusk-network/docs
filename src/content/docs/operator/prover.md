description: Learn how to install and run a Dusk Prover Node for generating zero-knowledge proofs within Dusk.

Provers carry on the computation-heavy task of creating Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZKP), which are a requirement for privacy-preserving transactions on Dusk and for certain ZK-powered applications.

Provers are specialized nodes responsible for handling the computationally intensive task of creating [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/learn/deep-dive/cryptography/zkp). These proofs are essential for enabling the privacy-preserving feature of the [Phoenix](/learn/deep-dive/transaction_models/phoenix) transaction model. Given the high computational demands of ZKPs, configuring a Prover with the right specifications is crucial to ensure optimal performance.
