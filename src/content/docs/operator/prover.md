description: Learn about Dusk Provers for generating zero-knowledge proofs within Dusk.
---

Provers carry on the computation-heavy task of creating Zero-Knowledge proofs (ZKP), which are a requirement for privacy-preserving transactions on Dusk and for certain ZK-powered applications.

Provers are specialized nodes responsible for handling the computationally intensive task of creating [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/learn/deep-dive/cryptography/zkp). These proofs are essential for enabling the privacy-preserving feature of the [Phoenix](/learn/deep-dive/transaction_models/phoenix) transaction model. Given the high computational demands of ZKPs, configuring a Prover with the right specifications is crucial to ensure optimal performance.

If you want to run a prover, you can run a [provisioner](/operator/provisioner), which includes the prover.

## Prover Specifications

The performance of a Prover largely depends on the number of workers that the server can manage simultaneously. Since generating ZK proofs is a single-threaded process, having strong single-core performance is vital to complete proofs efficiently and reduce transaction finalization time.
