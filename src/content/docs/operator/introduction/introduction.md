Dusk introduced an innovative consensus mechanism, called [Succict Attestation](/learn/deep-dive/succinct-attestation), which uses a *pure proof-of-stake* algorithm to provide sybil-resistance.

In Dusk there are three types of nodes: [Provisioners, Provers and Archivers](/operator/introduction/node_types), each of them relying on different [requirements](/operator/introduction/requirements). Dusk allows network participants to run their node in different configurations according to their specific needs.

## Why stake?

Nodes that want to actively contribute to the security of the network are called Provisioners. These nodes can stake DUSK by participating in the consensus, while accruing rewards for generating blocks and participating in block validation activities. These rewards are an incentive for creating blocks and voting, and compensate users for locking their assets while their node performs such operations.

## Staking Requirements

To run a Dusk Provisioner, at least **1000 DUSK** must be staked.

Keep in mind that to ensure security and network integrity, [hard-slashing and soft-slashing](/operator/introduction/slashing) mechanisms are in place.
