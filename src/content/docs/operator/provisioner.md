description: Discover what a Dusk Full Validator Node (Provisioner) is and how to participate in consensus and start staking.
---

Dusk supports multiple node configurations, with Provisioners being the full node equipped with participating in consensus. Participating in consensus is incentivized by the protocol through staking rewards. As the backbone of network security and transaction validation, Provisioners play a crucial role in processing and appending new blocks to the Dusk blockchain.

Provisioners are required to stake a **minimum of 1000 DUSK** to participate in the consensus mechanism. In return, they earn rewards for validating transactions and generating blocks, providing a financial incentive for securing the network. These rewards not only compensate users for locking up their assets but also encourage ongoing participation in block creation and voting.
