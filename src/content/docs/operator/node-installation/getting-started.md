Once having ensured you have the necessary [requirements](/operator/introduction/requirements) for the type of [node](/operator/introduction/node_types) you want to set up, you can choose to:

- Run the [installer script](/operator/node-installation/installer-script) to spin up a node on the Nocturne testnet
- Install the necessary dependencies and [build from source](/operator/node-installation/build-from-source)
- Use a [docker image](/operator/node-installation/docker-image)
