## Dusk terminology

#### Citadel

A self-sovereign identity system that is part of the Dusk protocol.

#### Confidential Security Contract Standard (XSC)

A standardized framework for confidential smart contracts, which any company or organization can customize according to business-specific requirements (e.g., complying with data privacy and financial regulations).

#### DUSK

The native cryptocurrency of Dusk. It is used to pay for transaction fees and staking.

#### Dusk VM

A general purpose virtual machine developed by Dusk that runs WASM smart contracts and manages their memory.

#### Kadcast

A structured information propagation protocol used by Dusk, characterized by a direct correlation between network performance, latency, and the number of nodes.

#### LUX

The smallest denomination of DUSK. 10^9 LUX = 1 DUSK, 1 DUSK = 1,000,000,000 LUX.

#### Moonlight

An account-based transaction model on Dusk that tracks balances for accounts and contracts, offering full transparency. It is faster and cheaper than Phoenix, making it easier for developers to integrate with external protocols.

#### Phoenix

A UTXO-based, privacy-preserving transaction model on Dusk used for transferring DUSK. It enables users to spend "notes" privately using zero-knowledge proofs without linking balances to addresses.

#### Public Account

A public account is based on the [Moonlight](#moonlight) account-based transaction model and is used for transparent, public transactions. It uses public addresses to provide full transparency.

#### Shielded Account

A shielded account is based on the [Phoenix](#phoenix) UTXO transaction model and is designed for privacy-preserving transactions. It utilizes shielded addresses for confidentiality while supporting regulatory compliance by making the sender known to the receiver.

#### Profile

A profile is a pairing of a Public Account ([Moonlight](#moonlight) and a Shielded Account ([Phoenix](#phoenix) derived from a single mnemonic. Profiles are created in pairs to allow for both public and private transactions.

#### Rusk

The official Dusk platform's Rust reference implementation.

#### Rusk Wallet

The official CLI wallet for Dusk, enabling users to manage DUSK, interact with the blockchain and execute transactions via a command-line interface.

#### Succinct Attestation

A unique Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm developed by Dusk which allows network participants to compete for block producer rights.

#### W3sper SDK

A JavaScript library for communication within the Dusk ecosystem, enabling developers to integrate Dusk dApps into (web) applications.

#### Web Wallet

The official web-based wallet for Dusk, providing users with an accessible way to manage DUSK and interact with the blockchain through a user-friendly interface.

#### Zedger

A Dusk protocol combining UTXO and account models for the private, compliant management of securities. Zedger allows issuers to digitally represent, issue, and trade securities like stocks and bonds while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Definitions

#### Account

In an account-based blockchain, a combination of a private key and a public key where a user's funds are stored as a balance.

#### Account-Based Transaction Model

A protocol that represents assets as balances within personal accounts, similar to bank accounts.

#### Address

#### Archive node

A type of full node in blockchain networks that stores the entire history of the blockchain, including all past states, transactions, and emitted events since the genesis block. Archive nodes enable deep historical data retrieval, supporting use cases like blockchain explorers, audits, and regulatory compliance.

#### Asset Token

A category of tokens that represent a “real world” asset or product — such as a commodity (e.g., gold) or currency (e.g., US dollar) — as opposed to utility tokens, which provide network-specific functions.

#### Balance

#### Consensus

A process where the majority of validators agree on the current state of the blockchain.

#### Cryptographic Hash Function

A special class of hash function that has certain properties in order to make it secure and ideal for cryptographic purposes, including the following: (i) it is deterministic, meaning it always produces the same result; (ii) it is fast, meaning it returns the hash of an input very quickly; (iii) it is pre-image resistant, meaning it is virtually impossible to determine the original input data from its hash value; and (iv) even a small change in the input data would result in a massive change to the hash value.

#### Information Propagation Protocol (IPP)

A software protocol used to distribute information across a (P2P) network. Information propagation protocols can be (i) structured (e.g., Kadcast), meaning the network communicates transactions and new blocks according to a pre-defined mechanism, or (ii) unstructured (e.g., Gossip), meaning the network communicates transactions and new blocks in a random manner.

#### Latency
