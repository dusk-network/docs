desccription: Learn about the economic protocol that underpins Duskâ€™s protocol incentives.

The Dusk's **economic protocol** represents a transformative approach to the utilization and functionality of smart contracts in blockchain technology. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol's features, their implications, and the opportunities they present for developers, enterprises, and users in the blockchain ecosystem.

## Key Features

The economic protocol enriches smart contracts on the Dusk with three innovative capabilities:

1. **The protocol (transfer contract) arbitrates smart contracts payments:** this feature enables smart contracts to function as revenue-generating tools, allowing developers to monetize their services. From a technical perspective, defining economic capabilities at protocol level has the benefit of standardizing payments across the whole Dusk ecosystem, allowing for financial composability beyond the applicative one. An immediate benefit of this is the capability in the future to perform payments in differently denominated tokens (such as stablecoin) while the gas remains denominated in `DUSK`

2. **Smart contracts can choose to pay gas fees:** by shifting the responsibility of gas fees from users to smart contracts, the protocol facilitates a more user-friendly experience, enhancing the mainstream appeal and adoption of blockchain technology.

3. **Developers can deploy _autocontracts_ : smart contracts that execute autonomously in response to an event:** smart contracts gain the ability to execute functions autonomously based on events emitted by other smart contracts. This is unprecedented in the blockchain world and can unlock advanced trading strategies, automated asset transfers, and optimized business processes.

## Impact and Benefits

The introduction of these capabilities significantly alters the landscape for blockchain development and user interaction. Key impacts include:

- **Improved developer flexibility:** greater creative freedom in designing business models on the blockchain.
- **Enhanced user experience:** lower barriers to entry for non-blockchain-savvy users, fostering mainstream adoption.
- **Economic efficiency:** potential for cost savings and automated operations for businesses and developers.

## Comparing Traditional vs. Dusk Smart Contracts

| Feature | Traditional Smart Contracts | Dusk Smart Contracts |
|:---------:|:-----------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| Fee mechanisms | Limited to transaction taxes | Can implement subscription fees |
| Gas payment | User responsibility | Smart contract responsibility |
| Autonomy | Limited function execution | Advanced autocontract capabilities |

The economic protocol paves the way for a seamless integration of traditional finance and blockchain technology, while also unlocking a plethora of new use cases and business models. The implementation of these features is not just an advancement but a necessity for the future of blockchain technology and its mass adoption.
