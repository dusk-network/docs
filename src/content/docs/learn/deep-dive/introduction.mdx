    <Card title="Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts">
Dusk VM facilitates the development of complex, privacy-focused dApps. It supports Smart Contracts written in rust or any programming language that targets WebAssembly (WASM) bytecode.
        <LinkCard title="Dusk VM: ZK-Friendly VM" href="/learn/deep-dive/dusk-vm"/>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Compliance">
        Dusk features a privacy-preserving digital identity protocol, Citadel, crucial for KYC/AML compliance. Moreover, the protocol features 
        <a href="https://dusk.network/news/why-we-need-phoenix-and-zedger">Zedger</a>, a transaction model which encodes Mifid II regulation and allows the issuance of [regulated financial products](/learn/deep-dive/assets-and-regulations/lifecycle).

    </Card>
    <Card title="Cryptography Empowerment">
        Our R&D team is at the forefront of research in zero-knowledge proof systems with several papers published and developed libraries.
        <LinkCard title="Publications and Research" href="/learn/deep-dive/additional-resources"/>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Finality and Scalability">
    Thanks to the <a href="">Kadcast networking protocol</a> and the succinct attestation consensus algorithm, Dusk can scale to millions of nodes without compromising time to finality, decentralization, and network efficiency.
        <LinkCard title="Succinct Attestation Consensus" href="/learn/deep-dive/succinct-attestation"/>
    </Card>
    <Card title="Economic Soundness">
Dusk's economic protocol allows service providers to be productized and generate revenue, incentivizes developers, and completely unlocks a new breed of use cases.
