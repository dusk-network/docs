Arithmetic Circuits allow for zero-knowledge (ZK) operations, and are used e.g., by our genesis contracts for these specific use-cases:

- [Phoenix](/learn/deep-dive/transaction_models/phoenix): to spend notes and pay for gas.
- [Citadel](/developer/digital-identity/protocol): to use in the Self-Sovereign Identity implementation.
- [Zedger](/learn/deep-dive/transaction_models/zedger): to use the Zedger transaction model and spent securities.

Developers can write their own ZK circuits as part of their smart contracts, allowing for the proving and verification of zero-knowledge proofs.

## Phoenix circuits

Circuits in Phoenix prove that the following conditions hold true:

1. **Membership**: Every note that is about to be spent is included in the Merkle tree of notes.
2. **Ownership**: The sender holds the note secret key for every note that is about to be spent.
3. **Nullification**: The nullifier is calculated correctly.
4. **Minting**: The value commitment for the newly minted notes are computed correctly.
5. **Balance integrity**: The sum of the values of all spent notes is equal to the sum of the values of all minted notes + the gas fee + a deposit, where a deposit refers to funds being transfered to a contract.

## Citadel circuits

Circuits in Citadel allow for the following actions:
Request Creation and Encryption:

1. **Stealth Address Generation:** A new stealth address is correctly generated using Diffie-Hellman.
2. **Data Encryption:** The license stealth address and an additional key are encrypted using the derived key.
3. **Session Initialization:** Public inputs are used to construct session data (e.g. session ID, session hash, commitments...).
4. **Verification**: Pedersen commitments and hash commitment are calculated and verified.
5. **Data Decryption:** Requested data is decrypted using the derived key.
6. **Signature Creation:** A signature for the license is generated using the license secret key and hash.
7. **License Data Encryption**: The signature and attribute data are encrypted with the public key of the license.
8. **Proof Generation**: A proof of membership in a Merkle tree is created.
9. **Proof Verification:**: Cryptographic commitments are computed and the signature of the session hash is verified.
