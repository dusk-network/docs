description: Use the Dusk’s block explorer for looking at transaction details.
---

Transactions can be viewed on the <a href="https://explorer.dusk.network/" target="_blank">Dusk Block Explorer</a>, along with statistics and information about the network.

Dusk is a privacy-preserving blockchain. Privacy-preserving [Phoenix](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models) transactions do not expose the sender, receiver and amount transferred to anyone other than the involved parties (sender, receiver, and users with the view key).

For public [Moonlight](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models) transactions or other types of chain interactions, the visibility of transaction details depends on the contract implementation and whether developers use privacy technology like zero-knowledge proofs.

The block explorer can be used to view the type of transactions submitted, as well as the payload, transaction fee and gas used.
