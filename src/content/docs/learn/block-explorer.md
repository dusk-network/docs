description: Use the Dusk block explorer to look up transactions, blocks, and fees.

You can view transactions and blocks on the <a href="https://explorer.dusk.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Dusk Block Explorer</a>.

Dusk is a privacy-preserving blockchain. Privacy-preserving [Phoenix](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models) transactions do not expose the sender, receiver and amount transferred to anyone other than the involved parties (sender, receiver, and users with the view key).

For public [Moonlight](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models) transactions or other types of chain interactions, the visibility of transaction details depends on the contract implementation and whether developers use privacy technology like zero-knowledge proofs.

The explorer can show the transaction type and metadata such as payload, fee, and gas used (depending on the transaction model and contract).
