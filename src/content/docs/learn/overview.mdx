Dusk is the privacy blockchain for regulated finance.

It lets you launch and use markets where:

- Institutions can meet real regulatory requirements on‑chain  
- Users get confidential balances and transfers instead of full public exposure  
- Developers build with familiar EVM tools plus native privacy and compliance primitives

Dusk combines:

- Zero‑knowledge technology for confidentiality  
- On‑chain compliance for MiCA / MiFID II / DLT Pilot Regime / GDPR‑style regimes  
- Succinct Attestation, a PoS consensus protocol for fast, final settlement  
- A modular architecture with DuskDS (data & settlement) and DuskEVM (EVM execution)

## What is Dusk?

Most financial markets still run on opaque, centralized systems.  
Dusk is built to move those workflows on‑chain without sacrificing:

- Regulatory compliance  
- Counterparty privacy  
- Execution speed and finality

On Dusk, institutions can issue and manage financial instruments while enforcing disclosure, KYC/AML, and reporting rules directly in the protocol.

In short: Dusk is a privacy-enabled, regulation-aware blockchain for institutional-grade finance.

## Why Dusk?

### Built for regulated markets

Dusk is designed around the needs of regulated financial institutions:

- Native support for compliant issuance of securities and RWAs  
- Identity and permissioning primitives that let you differentiate between public and restricted flows  
- On‑chain logic that can reflect real‑world obligations (eligibility, limits, reporting, etc.)

See: [Core Values](/learn/core-values) and [Tokenization & Native Issuance](/learn/tokenization-comparison).

### Privacy by design, transparent when needed

Dusk uses zero‑knowledge proofs and dual transaction models (Phoenix and Moonlight) to let users choose between:

- Public transactions for transparent flows, and  
- Shielded transactions for confidential balances and transfers,  
  with the ability to reveal information to authorized parties when required.

See: [Cryptography](/learn/cryptography) and [Transaction Models on Dusk](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models).

### Fast, final settlement

The Succinct Attestation consensus protocol is a proof‑of‑stake, committee‑based design:

- Deterministic finality once a block is ratified  
- No user‑facing reorgs in normal operation  
- Designed for high throughput and low‑latency settlement suitable for markets

See: [Succinct Attestation](/learn/deep-dive/succinct-attestation).

### Modular & EVM-friendly

Dusk separates settlement from execution, making it easier to match the right environment to each use case:
- DuskDS – consensus, data availability, settlement, and the privacy‑enabled transaction model  
- DuskEVM – an Ethereum‑compatible execution layer where DUSK is the native gas token  
- Native bridging between layers so assets can move where they’re most useful

See: [Core Components](/learn/core-components) and [DuskEVM Developer Docs](/developer/smart-contracts-dusk-evm/deploy-on-evm).

## What can you build on Dusk?

Some example use cases Dusk was designed for:

**Regulated digital securities**
- Tokenized equity, debt, or funds with embedded compliance rules  
- On‑chain corporate actions and transparent yet privacy‑respecting cap tables

**Institutional DeFi**
- Lending, AMMs, and structured products that must enforce KYC/AML  
- Separation of public market signals from private position details

**Payment & settlement rails**
- Confidential payments between institutions  
- Delivery‑versus‑payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets

**Self‑sovereign identity & access control**
- Permissioned venues where access is controlled via verifiable credentials  
- Compliance checks enforced in smart contracts instead of manual back‑office processes
