This page summarizes the principles behind Dusk and the tradeoffs they imply.
If you’re new, start with [Overview](/learn/overview) and then read [Core Components](/learn/core-components).

## Principles

### Regulated workflows, on-chain

Dusk is built for markets where rules are part of the product:

- eligibility and access controls
- disclosure and reporting requirements
- constraints like limits, holds, and transfer restrictions

### Privacy with selective disclosure

Dusk treats privacy as a protocol feature, not an application add-on:

- confidential balances and transfers where needed
- the ability to reveal information to authorized parties when required

For details, see [Cryptography](/learn/cryptography) and [Transaction Models](/learn/deep-dive/duskds-tx-models).

### Deterministic settlement

Market infrastructure needs predictable finality. DuskDS is designed for fast, deterministic settlement suitable for regulated venues.

### Modular architecture

Dusk separates settlement from execution so you can match the right environment to each use case:

- DuskDS for consensus, settlement, and privacy-capable transaction models
- DuskEVM for EVM-compatible application development

## Vision

Digital assets integrated into the decentralized global economy.

## Mission

:::tip[Dusk's mission]
Enable people and institutions to control and use their assets on-chain, within real-world constraints.

## Culture

We aim to be clear and rigorous in the way we build:

- write things down (docs, specs, and concrete examples)
- prefer secure-by-design primitives over “bolt-on” complexity
- keep developer UX practical (EVM where it helps, native where it matters)
