If you participated in the DUSK ERC20 staking incentive program (ITN2), your DUSK remains safely stored in the ERC20 staking smart contract. This guide walks you through the steps required to withdraw it manually using Etherscan.

:::note[Note]
This **only** applies to users who staked their DUSK using the ERC20 staking portal for the ITN2 incentive program (which happened before Dusk mainnet launch).

### Step 1 ‚Äì Open the staking contract on Etherscan

First, visit the staking contract page on Etherscan:

üëâ [0x4ab6ffa52460979dde1e442fb95f8bac56c3adc3 on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab6ffa52460979dde1e442fb95f8bac56c3adc3#readContract)

Then, navigate to the **"Contract"** tab:

### Step 2 ‚Äì Connect your Web3 wallet

Click on **‚ÄúConnect to Web3‚Äù**, and approve the connection using the same Ethereum address you used to stake your DUSK.
You will need to confirm the connection on the required wallet pop-ups.

### Step 3 ‚Äì Check your staked balance

Once you ensure that your wallet is now connected:

You can then look at the **"Read Contract"** section, and then find the [function called `balanceOf`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab6ffa52460979dde1e442fb95f8bac56c3adc3#readContract#F2).

You can then enter your Ethereum address and click **Query**, as this returns the exact number of DUSK tokens currently staked for that address:

### Step 4 ‚Äì Withdraw your staked DUSK

1. Switch to the **‚ÄúWrite Contract‚Äù** tab.
2. Find the [function called `withdraw`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4ab6ffa52460979dde1e442fb95f8bac56c3adc3#writeContract#F3).
3. Enter the **exact amount** shown by `balanceOf`.
