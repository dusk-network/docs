As the <a href="https://www.bnbchain.org/en/blog/final-sunset-plan-of-bnb-beacon-chain" target="_blank">Binance Beacon Chain is sunsetting</a>, there have been multiple communications over the past months to facilitate the migration of BEP2 DUSK tokens to BEP20 DUSK.

This guide provides a step-by-step process for BEP2 DUSK token holders to successfully migrate their tokens.


:::note[Important]
Both Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-will-support-the-bnb-beacon-chain-bep2-network-sunset-plan-9effc62ec5f74839a19f8554b5dbb349" target="_blank">Binance</a>  and [Dusk](https://discord.com/channels/847466263064346624/1118584438780084224/1223360077034160230) have issued numerous updates about the migration process, allowing ample time for users to convert their tokens. Thanks to these efforts, the majority of BEP2 DUSK tokens have already been transitioned. However, for those who missed the deadline, ad-hoc conversion options will be available on a case-by-case basis. While there is no fixed timeline for these conversions, Dusk team plans to address these cases when possible.

## Why Migrate?

The migration to BEP20 is crucial due to the sunsetting of the Binance Beacon Chain. Migrating ensures that your DUSK tokens remain usable, and can be bridge to mainnet in the future.

## What You Will Need

Before starting the migration process, please ensure you have:

* A wallet holding your BEP2 DUSK tokens, with a small amount of BNB
* A Binance Smart Chain-compatible wallet for receiving your BEP20 DUSK tokens (for example [BNB Chain Wallet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/binance-wallet) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

## Migration Process

### Step 1: Gas

Ensure that you have a small amount of BNB in your wallet to cover the network fees for the transaction.

### Step 2: Sending BEP2 DUSK Tokens

1. Access your wallet holding the BEP2 DUSK tokens. This can be done through the [BNB Chain Wallet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/binance-wallet) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/).

2. Initiate a transfer to our Dusk controlled migration wallet: `bnb1dfls6c8y39l7qq4gj2479wkehg85pt5m07y94g`

**IMPORTANT**: In the MEMO field of the transaction, enter the receiving address of your BEP20-compatible wallet. **The address should be in a `0x` format**. This step is **crucial** to ensure your BEP20 DUSK tokens are sent to a correct address.

### Step 3: Receiving BEP20 DUSK Tokens 

The Dusk team will process migrations in batches. Your BEP20 DUSK tokens will be distributed to the provided BEP20 wallet address on May the 1st 2024.

## After Migration

Dusk will make an announcement when the payout has been completed. Once you receive your BEP20, verify the receipt in your BEP20-compatible wallet.
