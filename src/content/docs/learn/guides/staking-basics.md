Staking is a vital component of Dusk, ensuring decentralization and security. 
By staking your DUSK, you contribute to the network's integrity and consensus mechanism, enabling efficient and secure transaction validation. Staking is a way for everyone to actively support the network while earning rewards for their participation.

## Why Stake?

Staking DUSK allows you to:

- Earn rewards and grow your holdings.
- Participate in consensus and increase the security of Dusk.

## What do you need to start?
To begin staking, you need:

- At least **1000 DUSK**: This is the minimum amount required to participate.
- **Time for maturity**: Your stake becomes active after 2 epochs (about **4320 blocks**).
- Choosing a **node** that handles your stake and participate in the consensus process.

:::note[Important]
After having staked your tokens, **it takes some time before you start earning rewards**. This is because your stake becomes active after the maturity period (4320 blocks). The maturity period of 4320 blocks corresponds to **approximately 12 hours** (based on an average block time of 10 seconds). Before expecting rewards, ensure to account for this waiting period.

## How are Rewards determined?

Rewards are probabilistically allocated based on your node's participation in the network's consensus process. 

**Once** your stake is active, you start earn rewards, which come from:

- Your node proposing a block.
- Your node voting on a block.
- Token emissions as outlined in the [tokenomics](/learn/tokenomics#token-emission) page.

Your **rewards depend on the size of your stake relative to the total network stake**. Larger stakes increase your likelihood of being selected to propose or validate blocks, leading to more frequent rewards. Conversely, smaller stakes may experience longer intervals between rewards.

You can learn more on how the Succinct Attestation consensus works [here](/learn/deep-dive/succinct-attestation).

:::note[Important]
The more DUSK you stake, the more likely you are to earn rewards as an active participant in the network.

## Are there any risks?
To keep the network secure, Dusk relies on a [slashing mechanism](/operator/provisioner#slashing). This means that if your stake is handled by a node that submits invalid blocks or that is not constantly online, part of your stake can be reduced.
This allows the system to reward honest and reliable participants while discouraging harmful behavior.

## Ready to Stake?

Staking is a great way to earn rewards and participate in Dusk’s ecosystem.

Staking not only benefits you through rewards but also strengthens the Dusk network’s security and decentralization.
