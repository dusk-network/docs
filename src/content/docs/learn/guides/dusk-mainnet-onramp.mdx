description: Step-by-step guide on how to move BEP20 and ERC20 DUSK to be included in the Dusk mainnet genesis.
---

Welcome to the official guide for interacting with the Dusk Mainnet On-Ramp smart contract through Etherscan and BSCscan. This guide explains how to **deposit** and **stake** ERC20/BEP20 DUSK tokens to be included in the Dusk mainnet genesis block. This guide is for **advanced crypto users** and **professional node operators**. Providing the wrong address can lead to a loss of funds!

## **What You'll Need**

1. **ERC20/BEP20 DUSK tokens** in a supported wallet.
2. **A Web3 wallet**, like MetaMask.
3. **Your Dusk Mainnet Target Address**: This is your unique Dusk public account address used for native DUSK issuance.
4. **Access to Etherscan/BSCscan**: Weâ€™ll interact with the contracts directly through their verified pages.

## **Considerations**

- **No Refunds:** Tokens cannot be retrieved once deposited or staked. This is a one-way operation.
- **Minimum Requirements:** Ensure you meet minimum amounts before interacting, 1 [LUX](/learn/glossary#lux) (in wei, 1 LUX = 10^9 wei, 1 DUSK = 10^18 wei) for depositing, 1000 DUSK for staking.
- **Correct Address:** Double-check your public account address before submitting! If you provide the wrong one, your funds could be lost!

## DUSK-to-wei calculator

import DuskConverter from './DuskConverter.astro';

To avoid miscalculations when entering values in wei, use the built-in DUSK-to-wei Converter below:

<DuskConverter />

## **Address Verifier**  

import AddressVerifier from './AddressVerifier.astro';

Use this tool to verify that your Dusk public account address meets both requirements:  
- **Correct Length:** 131 or 132 characters
- **Base58 Validity:** Contains only valid Base58 characters

If your address passes verification, it is reasonably like it's a valid `targetAddress`.

<AddressVerifier />

## **Interacting with the Contract**

### **Step 1: Generate a Dusk Wallet**
1. Use the **Rusk Wallet** to generate a mnemonic and create your Dusk wallet.
2. **Store your mnemonic securely.**
3. Copy the **Public Account** address from the wallet and use it as the `targetAddress`.

### **Step 2: Approve the Contract to Use Your DUSK Tokens**

Before depositing or staking, you must allow the on-ramp contract to spend your DUSK tokens:

**Warning:** It is recommended to perform both **deposit** and **stake** transactions. If you only stake, you will not have funds available for essential network transactions like reward withdrawals or transfers.

## **Checking Transactions and Balances**

After depositing or staking, verify your transaction status on Etherscan/BSCscan through your wallet. 

## **FAQ**

### **What happens after depositing or staking?**
Your tokens will be on-ramped on Dusk mainnet, and a corresponding genesis balance will be issued on the Dusk mainnet on January 7th, 2025.

### **What if I miss the deadlines?**
You will not be able to participate in the genesis state of Dusk.

### **Can I deposit/stake multiple times?**
Yes, but each transaction must meet the minimum amounts.

### **Can you describe a couple scenarios?**

1. **User Pippo**: He sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. As of _Genesis_ on the 29th, he holds a 10,000 DUSK stake, and his node begins participating in consensus. By January 7, he starts accruing rewards.

2. **User Pluto**: He sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. As of _Genesis_ on the 29th, he holds a 10,000 DUSK stake, but since he does not run a node, he never participates in consensus. _His 10,000 DUSK is removed from the active stakes and credited back as a deposit on January 3._ By January 7, he holds his original deposit but no active stake. At that point, he can choose to run a node by re-staking and waiting through the two-epoch maturity period.

3. **User Paperino**: He sends 900 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the deposit method. His deposit is recorded at _Genesis_ and available from that point on (on December 29th, on January 3rd and  on January 7th).

4. **User Topolino**: He does not send any DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract by January 2. He can only move his funds onto Mainnet after January 7, and must use the bridge to do so.
