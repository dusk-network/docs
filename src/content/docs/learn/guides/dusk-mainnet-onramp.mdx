title: Dusk Mainnet On-Ramp
description: Step-by-step guide on how to move BEP20 and ERC20 DUSK to be included in the Dusk mainnet genesis.
---

The on-ramp of DUSK to Dusk mainnet has ended. The staking period has ended as of **December 28th, 23:59 CET**. The deposit period has ended as of **January 2nd, 23:59 CET**.
DUSK not deposited or staked by these dates can only be migrated to Dusk mainnet using the [mainnet migration bridge](/learn/guides/mainnet-migration) after January 7th.

## **On-ramp contracts**

The contracts used for the Dusk genesis state can be found below:

## **On-ramp Genesis State**

You can find the genesis on-ramp state for ERC20 DUSK [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusk-network/dusk-migration/refs/heads/genesis-state/genesis-state-eth.toml) and for BEP20 DUSK [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dusk-network/dusk-migration/refs/heads/genesis-state/genesis-state-bsc.toml).


### **Can you describe a couple scenarios?**

1. **User Pippo**: He sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. As of _Genesis_ on the 29th, he holds a 10,000 DUSK stake, and his node begins participating in consensus. By January 7, he starts accruing rewards. Pippo did not do a `deposit` and will have to bridge DUSK through our [mainnet migration bridge](/learn/guides/mainnet-migration), or receive DUSK from a friend, to transfer DUSK and withdraw staking rewards.

2. **User Pluto**: He sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. As of _Genesis_ on the 29th, he holds a 10,000 DUSK stake, but since he does not run a node, he never participates in consensus. _His 10,000 DUSK is removed from the active stakes and credited back as a deposit on January 3._ By January 7, he holds his original deposit but no active stake. At that point, he can choose to run a node by re-staking and waiting through the two-epoch maturity period.

3. **User Paperino**: He sends 900 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the deposit method. His deposit is recorded at _Genesis_ and available from that point on (on December 29th, on January 3rd and  on January 7th).

4. **User Topolino**: He does not send any DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract by January 2. He can only move his funds onto Mainnet after January 7, and must use the [mainnet migration bridge](/learn/guides/mainnet-migration) to do so.
