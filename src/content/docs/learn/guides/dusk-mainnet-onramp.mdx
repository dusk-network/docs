description: Step-by-step guide on how to move BEP20 and ERC20 DUSK to be included in the Dusk mainnet genesis.
---

Welcome to the official guide for interacting with the Dusk Mainnet On-Ramp smart contract through Etherscan and BSCscan. This guide explains how to **deposit** and **stake** ERC20/BEP20 DUSK tokens to be included in the Dusk mainnet genesis block. This guide is for advanced users, providing the wrong address can lead to a loss of funds!

## **What You'll Need**

1. **ERC20/BEP20 DUSK tokens** in a supported wallet.
2. **A Web3 wallet**, like MetaMask.
3. **Your Dusk Mainnet Target Address**: This is your unique Dusk public account address used for native DUSK issuance.
4. **Access to Etherscan/BSCscan**: We’ll interact with the contracts directly through their verified pages.

## **Considerations**

- **No Refunds:** Tokens cannot be retrieved once deposited or staked. This is a one-way operation.
- **Minimum Requirements:** Ensure you meet minimum amounts before interacting, 1 LUX for depositing, 1000 DUSK for staking.
- **Correct Address:** Double-check your public account address before submitting! If you provide the wrong one, your funds could be lost!

## **Interacting with the Contract**

### **Step 1: Generate a Dusk Wallet**
1. Use the **Rusk Wallet** to generate a mnemonic and create your Dusk wallet.
2. **Store your mnemonic securely.**
3. Copy the **Public Account** address from the wallet and use it as the `targetAddress`.

### **Step 2: Approve the Contract to Use Your DUSK Tokens**

Before depositing or staking, you must allow the on-ramp contract to spend your DUSK tokens:

**Warning:** It is recommended to perform both **deposit** and **stake** transactions. If you only stake, you will not have funds available for essential network transactions like reward withdrawals or transfers.

## **Checking Transactions and Balances**

After depositing or staking, verify your transaction status on Etherscan/BSCscan through your wallet. 

## **FAQ**

### **What happens after depositing or staking?**
Your tokens will be locked, and a corresponding genesis balance will be issued on the Dusk mainnet on January 7th, 2025.

### **What if I miss the deadlines?**
You will not be able to participate in the genesis state of Dusk.

### **Can I deposit/stake multiple times?**
Yes, but each transaction must meet the minimum amounts.

### **Can you describe a couple scenarios?**

1. **User Pippo**: sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. On the 29th at genesis Pippo has a stake of 10,000. Pippo’s node starts to participate in the consensus. On the 7th of January Pippo will start accruing rewards ✅

2. **User Pluto**: sends 10,000 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `stake` method. On the 29th at genesis Pluto has a stake of 10,000 but he has no node and fails to participate in the consensus. His 10,000 DUSK will be removed from the active stakes but will be accredited as a deposit on the 3rd of January. On the 7th of January Pluto will have its deposit available but no active stake. At that point he can run a node by staking and incurring in the maturity period of 2 epochs. ✅

3. **User Paperino**: sends 900 DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract using the `deposit` method. On the 29th his deposit will be saved in the genesis block. ✅

4. **User Topolino**: does not send any DUSK to the Mainnet Onramp contract by the 2nd of January. He can onramp his funds on Mainnet only after the 7th and by using the bridge ✅
