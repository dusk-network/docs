## Getting help

- For documentation fixes and requests, contribute in the docs repo: <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/docs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">dusk-network/docs</a>.
- For protocol/app questions, use Discord.
- Be careful with DMs and links. Official channels will never ask for your seed phrase or private keys.
