description: Choose between DuskEVM and DuskDS and start building on Dusk.

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Dusk has a **modular architecture** with:

- **DuskDS** – the settlement and data layer (consensus, data availability, native transaction models, protocol contracts, DuskVM).
- **DuskEVM** – the EVM execution layer where most smart contracts and dApps live.

As a builder you usually:

- write and deploy contracts on **DuskEVM**, and
- rely on DuskDS for finality, privacy and settlement under the hood.

## When to use DuskEVM

Use **DuskEVM** for almost all application‑level use cases:

- DeFi protocols, AMMs, lending, RWAs
- NFTs and gaming
- Apps that expect an EVM environment (tooling, libraries, infra)

You get:

- Familiar languages and tooling (Solidity/Vyper, Hardhat/Foundry, etc.)
- DUSK as the native gas token
- Privacy & compliance features via the underlying DuskDS architecture and Hedger.

See: [Smart Contracts on DuskEVM](/developer/smart-contracts-dusk-evm/deploy-on-evm).

## When to use DuskDS contracts

Use DuskDS smart contracts only when you need:

- protocol‑level control on the settlement layer,
- direct interaction with the DuskDS transaction models, or
- specialised contracts that must run “next to” consensus.

Typical examples include:

- genesis / protocol contracts (transfers, staking),
- low‑level infrastructure contracts,
- experiments that need direct access to the DuskDS VM and its unique features.

If that’s you, start with:  
[Smart Contracts on DuskDS](/developer/smart-contracts-duskds).

## Examples

You can explore existing contracts and examples in the Dusk repos:

- Protocol contracts in [`rusk/contracts`](https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/contracts)
- The DuskDS example [`my-first-contract`](https://github.com/dusk-network/my-first-contract)
- DuskEVM examples in the [DuskEVM docs](/developer/smart-contracts-dusk-evm/deploy-on-evm)
