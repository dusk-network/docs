The  <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/tree/master/w3sper.js" target="_blank">W3sper SDK</a> is a comprehensive toolkit of modules designed to facilitate the development of applications that interact seamlessly with the Dusk network.  W3sper ensures secure, flexible interactions directly within the user's environment, eliminating the need for installations

It empowers developers to deploy not just smart contracts but also the complete user experience, including custom UIs for transaction generation and contract interaction. W3sper allows developers to obtain a rich expressiveness and a standard way to define the client UX.

The W3sper SDK includes the following core features:

- **Address & Account Management**: Easily generate and manage user profiles and addresses, streamlining user onboarding and identity management.
- **Balance and Transaction Management**: Check balances, create signed transactions, and manage gas effectively.
- **Event Subscription**: Stay up-to-date with network events and access blockchain data in real-time.
- **Proof Management**: Generate and delegate Zero Knowledge proofs.


## Implementations

The W3sper SDK is available in two implementations:

-** Web SDK**: A JavaScript-based SDK designed for web applications, allowing for seamless integration with browser-based DApps.
- **Native SDK**: Built in Rust and available in a separate repository, ideal for native applications requiring high-performance execution.
