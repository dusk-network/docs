title: RUES
description: Dusk's node event system explained.
---

The <a href="https://github.com/dusk-network/rusk/wiki/RUES-%28Rusk-Universal-Event-System%29" target="_blank">**Rusk Universal Event System (RUES)**</a> is an integral part of the architecture of Dusk, providing a powerful mechanism for handling real-time communication with an event-driven approach.

RUES is designed to handle binary proofs, binary streams, and on-demand event-driven data, making it ideal for applications that need to process binary proofs or continuous binary data streams.
It also enables on-demand data dispatching and real-time notifications, supporting applications like wallet operations that require high-performance binary data handling.
This is achieved by avoiding the need to convert data to JSON or base64.

## Session Management

Before interacting with RUES, clients must establish a WebSocket session with a Rusk node. This session forms the backbone of real-time event streaming between the client and the node.

### Session Initialization

To start a session, initiate a WebSocket connection to the node. Upon connection, the server responds with a `Rusk-Session-Id`, a 16 byte random nonce that is essential for event subscriptions and dispatches.

```
wss://[node-address]/on
```

### Session Persistence 

Ensure that your WebSocket connection remains open for as long as you require real-time event streaming. In a load-balanced environment, consistent routing is required to maintain session persistence.

### Session Termination

Sessions can be terminated by either the client or the server. When the WebSocket connection is closed, all event subscriptions are automatically canceled.

## Event Identification

Every event in RUES is identified by a unique URL structure, which allows for fine-grained interaction with blockchain components.

### Event URL Structure

```
/on/[target]/[topic]
```

- **target**: The blockchain component (e.g., `contracts`, `transactions`, `blocks`, `node`, `graphql`).
- **topic**: The event type (e.g., `accepted`, `statechange`, `propagate`).

**Example URLs**:
- **General Event**: `/on/contracts/deploy`
- **Specific Event**: `/on/contracts:contract_id/[topic]`

In more granular cases, the `target` can represent specific elements within components. For example:

```
/on/transactions:transaction_id/included
/on/blocks:block_hash/accepted
```

## Event Subscriptions

RUES enables clients to subscribe to specific events on a node. Subscriptions use the HTTP `GET` method and require the `Rusk-Session-Id` for authentication.

### Subscribe

#### Request

```
GET https://[node-address]/on/[target]/[topic]
```

#### Example

```
GET https://nodes.dusk.network/on/contracts:efda355bc94a3be09006dc90f3714a0ee22c586c5e577e429ef3b5e3e464a8da/item-added
```

#### Headers

| Name              | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Rusk-Version`    | Specifies the compatible Rusk version |
| `Rusk-Session-Id` | Identifies the current session        |

#### Response Codes

| Status code             | When                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`                | Successful subscription               |
| `400 Bad Request`       | `Rusk-Version` incompatibility        |
| `424 Failed Dependency` | `Rusk-Session-Id` issues              |
| `404 Not Found`         | `[component]` or `[target]` not found |

### Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe from an event, use the HTTP `DELETE` method.

#### Request

```
DELETE https://[node-address]/on/[target]/[topic]
```

#### Example 

```
DELETE https://nodes.dusk.network/on/contracts:efda355bc94a3be09006dc90f3714a0ee22c586c5e577e429ef3b5e3e464a8da/item-removed
```

#### Headers

| Name              | Description                           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `Rusk-Version`    | Specifies the compatible Rusk version |
| `Rusk-Session-Id` | Identifies the current session        |

#### Response Codes

| `424 Failed Dependency` | `Rusk-Session-Id` issues                         |
| `404 Not Found`         | `[component]`, `[target]` or `[topic]` not found |

## Event Dispatch

Dispatching events allows clients to send specific data to the node and request data. The `POST` method is used for this purpose, often including a request body with the event payload.

### Dispatch

#### Request

```
POST https://[node-address]/on/[target]/[topic]
```

#### Example

```
POST https://nodes.dusk.network/on/contracts:efda355bc94a3be09006dc90f3714a0ee22c586c5e577e429ef3b5e3e464a8da/sync
