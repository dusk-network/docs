## What is a RFP?
A Request for Proposals (RFP) is a document seeking bids from potential providers to undertake a specific project. RFPs are used to promote fair competition and ensure that the selection process is transparent and unbiased.

By soliciting detailed proposals, Dusk's Grants Committee can compare different approaches and solutions. This helps in identifying the best fit based on criteria such as cost, expertise, timeline, and the quality of the proposed solution.
